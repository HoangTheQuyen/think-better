# Specification Quality Checklist: Skill CLI Packager

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Note: The spec mentions Go's `embed` package and `filepath` package in the Assumptions and Edge Cases sections. These are acceptable as implementation *assumptions* (documenting likely approach) rather than requirements. The Functional Requirements and Success Criteria themselves remain technology-agnostic.
- FR-002 syntax examples use CLI flag notation which is appropriate for describing user-facing behavior, not implementation.
